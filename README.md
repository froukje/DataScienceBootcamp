# Data Science Bootcamp [@neuefische](https://www.neuefische.de/) Feb-May 2020

Notebooks: 
* Exercises considering different topics in Python

Project1_ KingCountyHousePrices:
* First project (in week 3 of the Bootcamp)
* Exploratory Data Analysis based on a [dataset for house prices in King County](Project1_KingCountyHousePrice/King_County_House_prices_dataset.csv)
* Objective: Predict House Prices with a linear regression analysis, depending on selected features in the dataset

Project2_Personality_vs_RiskDrugUse:
* Second project (in week 6 of the Bootcamp)
* Collabarative project together with [@BinaerBaer](https://github.com/BinaerBaer/)
* Dataset: A survay of people considering their demographic background, education and drug consumption
* Exploratory Data Analysis based on the [survay dataset](Project2_Personality_vs_RiskDrugUse/drug_consumption.xls)
* Objective: Classify drug usage risk using different ML classifiers and hyperparameter tuning on a specific metric  

Project3_Capstone_Classify_Bloodcells
* Final project (Capstone/"Digitales Gesellenst√ºck")
* Dataset: Images of four types of white blood cells from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/blood-cells)
* Objective: Classify white blood cells:
    * Granulocytes vs. Agranulocytes
    * Lymphocytes vs. Rest
    * Classify all four types
* Different techniques are used:
    * Binary classification using a PCA for dimension reduction and ML algorithms (using hyperparameter tuning and stacking)
    * Multiple classification using a CNN
    * Transfer Learning
